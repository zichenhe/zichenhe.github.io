I'm a senior undergraduate ME student from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I was once a student from Sichuan Univerity, also majoring in mechanical engineering. My research area is about fluid mechanics.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aaron Towne](http://atowne.com) in mechanical engineering, working on information-theoretical flux(causality) to analyze dynamical system. At 2024 fall semester, I am working with Prof.Alex Gorodetsky to work on a project about applying walking on spheres method to compute Poissonâ€™s equation parallely using GPU. 

You can find my CV here: [Zichen He's CV](../assets/CV_Zichen_He0904.pdf).
